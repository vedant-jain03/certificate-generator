<h2> What is Hacktoberfest? </h2>
<p>HACKTOBERFEST IS DIGITALOCEANâ€™S ANNUAL EVENT THAT ENCOURAGES PEOPLE TO CONTRIBUTE TO OPEN SOURCE THROUGHOUT OCTOBER. MUCH OF MODERN TECH INFRASTRUCTUREâ€”INCLUDING SOME OF DIGITALOCEANâ€™S OWN PRODUCTSâ€”RELIES ON OPEN-SOURCE PROJECTS BUILT AND MAINTAINED BY PASSIONATE PEOPLE WHO OFTEN DONâ€™T HAVE THE STAFF OR BUDGETS TO DO MUCH MORE THAN KEEP THE PROJECT ALIVE. HACKTOBERFEST IS ALL ABOUT GIVING BACK TO THOSE PROJECTS, SHARPENING SKILLS, AND CELEBRATING ALL THINGS OPEN SOURCE, ESPECIALLY THE PEOPLE THAT MAKE OPEN SOURCE SO SPECIAL.

FOR THE PAST 9 YEARS, THOUSANDS OF PEOPLEâ€”CODERS AND NON-CODERS ALIKEâ€”HAVE PARTICIPATED IN HACKTOBERFEST TO SUPPORT THE PROJECTS THEY USE AND LOVE, LEARN AND PRACTICE SKILLS THAT WILL ENHANCE THEIR CAREERS, AND MEET NEW PEOPLE WHO LOVE OPEN SOURCE AS MUCH AS THEY DO.</p>
